# Thoughts & Ramblings

Sometimes, math can truly help during problem solving. While I was doing some HackerRank challenges, I stumbled upon some cases that required MCD (Maximum Common Divisor) and LCM (Least Common Multiple) to reach the final result. Therefore, after doing some research and re-learning some things I might have forgotten a while ago - don't tell anybody - I decided to save these functions. Maybe I will never use them again, but maybe they might also help someone.
